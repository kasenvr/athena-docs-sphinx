## Metaverse Server (Codename Apollo)

The [metaverse server](https://github.com/kasenvr/project-apollo) and [metaverse server interface](https://github.com/kasenvr/project-apollo-dashboard) are progressing well. The metaverse server is currently being rewritten in TypeScript with Node.JS in order to improve its capabilities for the long term.

## Vircadia Launcher (Codename Pantheon)
